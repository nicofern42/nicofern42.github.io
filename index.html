I made this with Sam Weinfield using Unity and C#.
I programmed the player and camera movement, inventory, and sound effects. I also did the zoomer, ripper, and zeb enemy types. For the bonus level, I designed the zoomer transformation and labyrinth part of the level. Credits: Nintendo for assets + design of Metroid and Umich for the base Unity tutorial.
